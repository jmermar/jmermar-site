          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>I'm Jose Mero√±o Martinez, a developer with a degree on Computer Science based in Spain. I've worked mainly as a web developer in technologies such as NodeJs and Java.
          </p>
          <p>However, I'm not only interested in web development but in many aspects of programming, being game development and computer graphics some of them.
          </p>
          <p>During several years I've worked on multiple side projects that now I want to showcase. Thus, I created this website for hosting them as well as links to their github repositories.
            They are mainly made with either C or C++ and using some kind of graphics API such as Opengl or Vulkan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from development I also love mathematics, reading, and climbing. Now I'm also self-studying Japanese.
